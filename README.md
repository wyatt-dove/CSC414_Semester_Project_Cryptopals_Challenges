# CSC414_Semester_Project_Cryptopals_Challenges

### Introduction
This is a program that explores the Cryptopals Cryptography Challenges in C++, which can be found here: https://cryptopals.com

This repository is managed by Wyatt Dove (wyatt-dove), Daphney Davis (NefertariCooks), Jordan Livingston (jl42geek), Kristopher Gavin (Wolfire35), and Cole Brady (Cole-Brady).

**Current Progress: Set 1, Challenges 1-8 Complete**

### Overview
This program currently solves the following challenges:
- Set 1, Challenge 1: Convert hex to base64
- Set 1, Challenge 2: Fixed XOR
- Set 1, Challenge 3: Single-byte XOR cipher
- Set 1, Challenge 4: Detect single-character XOR
- Set 1, Challenge 5: Implement repeating-key XOR
- Set 1, Challenge 6: Break repeating-key XOR
- Set 1, Challenge 7: AES in ECB mode
- Set 1, Challenge 8: Detect AES in ECB mode

It navigates these solutions through the console via a text-based menu.

This program was coded and compiled using Visual Studio Community 2022. External libraries used include various Cryptography libraries from OpenSSL v1.1.1.
